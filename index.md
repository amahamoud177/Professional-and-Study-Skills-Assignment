# Professional and Study Skills Assignment

## Enterprise Authoring and Presentation Tools
In this module, we covered Microsoft Word, Powerpoint and Excel. Microsoft Word can be used to create documents (Microsoft, no date), Microsoft Powerpoint can be used to create presentations (Microsoft, no date) and Microsoft Excel is a tool used for data management (Microsoft, no date). Throughout my academic and professional career, I have used these tools in various ways. In school, I have used Word to create academic documents for my subjects and Powerpoint for presentations. Before coming starting this module I was already proficient in Word and Powerpoint. Excel, however, I have always struggled with. I haven't used Excel as extensively compared to Word and Powerpoint. By the end of this module, I am far more proficient at Excel than before the module started. In week 5, we were given a data set that consisted of participants, their age and sex, qualification level, last course of study, their access to a laptop, if they have any special needs and if they enjoy group work. I was able to create a graph that shows the correlation between age and qualification levels. One of the advantages of Excel for data management is that you are able to create graphs in a very simple and intuitive way. All you have to do is right click on the columns you wish to represent the axes and click on the desired graph (Microsoft, no date). The downside to this however is that you are not allowed to create any graphs outside of what Microsoft have offered. This creates rigidity in what someone can create with Excel. 

As I have mentioned before, I was already quite proficient in Microsoft Word. I have used it for a vast range of things such as academic work to CVs. Within this module, I have used Microsoft Word to create a CV. In the "Abubakar Mahamoud.docx" file (which can be found in the repo), I have a title that is my name and a subtitle that is my current role. It shows my experience and skills as well as my education. I used Word to create this CV as it allows to change the font, the size of font, move text to the right, middle or left of the page. The one downside to Microsoft Word is that it can be quite unintuitive. If you want to insert a picture, it may end up shifting the format of the document (Cook, 2015). Before I started this module, I already had quite an extensive experience using Microsoft Powerpoint. One advantage of Powerpoint is its ease of use. It is quite intuitive in its design and can allow for visually appealing presentation to be made. In the "AI impact on food industry.pptx" presentation, I made use of transitions to create an engaging flow between the slides. Another strong advantage of Powerpoint is that you can pick a design to create a visually appealing presentation. This means that you won't have to create or format a design from scratch (Advantages and Disadvantages of PowerPoint, no date). 

In regards to AI integration within these tools, AI can be used to streamline tasks. Some of theses features in Word are drafting the task, starting from a template, grammar and spelling checking (Microsoft, no date).  In Powerpoint, AI integration can be used to get instant feedback on a presentation. It can also be used to format text and graphics with AI recommendations (Microsoft, no date). In Excel, AI integration can be used to format data and highlight key information. It can also be used to give insights to your data and create visualisations (Microsoft, no date). In conclusion, I started this module with a good understanding of Microsoft Word and Powerpoint but was unconfident in Excel and finished with a firmer understanding of these tools. I will further develop my skills for each tool by learning how to format correctly with Microsoft Word, improve my data analysis skills for Excel and better structuring of information within slides in Powerpoint.

## Information Literacy
In this module, we covered how to find academic papers and studies and how to critically judge their quality using modern academic databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. Before I had started this module, I relied mostly on Google Scholar, which has non-peer reviewed studies which can lead to finding biased or incomplete research. The benefit of Scopus is that it only has peer reviewed studies whihch means the information is far more reliable. In Scopus, you can search for studies through key words, authors, affiliation etc. You can use search modifier such as "AND", "OR" and "NOT" to further tighten search results. In the example below, I used the search query "artificial intelligence" OR "AI" AND "food quality" to find peer reviewed studies about how AI has impacted the food industry.

You can further narrow down your search through the use of filters such as year, subject area, document type. These features allow for an effective way to find peer reviewed studies that directly relate to the research topic.

In this module, we also learnt PICO, a method of structuring academic queries, so that we find accurate and relevant studies. PICO stands for Population (who/what was being investigated), Intervention (the change/condition), Comparison (what you compare against) and Outcome (what you measure) (CASP, 2025). One of the major advantages of is that it allows for a structured question to be asked that will result in effective and relevant studies (CASP 2025). For example, in the image below, I used the search query ""artificial intelligence" AND "food quality" AND "food industry"" which resulted in 162 peer reviewed studies regarding AI's impact on the food industry and quality.

Although PICO can create strong structured questions, it can also favour experimental or observational studies by nature. PICO does not account for complexities such as feasibility, context, and sociocultural acceptability (PICO framework limitations, no date). For example the query, ""food industry employees" AND "artifical intelligence" AND "decision making"" results in 0 studies on Scopus. Although this may be because AI itself is experimental, it also results in no studies because something like "decision making" is inherently hard to measure.

Evaluating sources for credibility is important to academic research as it allows for accurate and trustworthy information to be conveyed. Credible sources make sure that the information being conveyed is truthful (Jones, 2024). One way to check if a source is credible is to check whether it is peer reviewed or not. Peer reviewing is the process in which experts from a field evaluate the quality of a peer's work (Wiley Author Services, 2013). This allows for the accuracy of the findings to be assessed so that they don't spread misinformation. Although peer reviewing allows for the accuracy and the bias of the work to be assessed, it is not perfect. Sometimes studies that are inaccurate may pass. In conclusion, evaluating the credibility of sources allows for the correct information to be conveyed and peer reviewing is one method of evaluating the crediblity. Before I started this module, my ability to search for academic was very basic. But after finishing this module, I am able to find, assess and accurately find studies that are relevant and trustworthy to my research topics.

## Coding and Collaboration Platforms
In this module, we learnt how to use collaborative platforms such as Git, Github and Github pages. These tools are used for collaboration, managing version control of source code. Github is a cloud based platform that allows for collaboration. It stores git repositories in the cloud. From there you can make pull or push requests and allows for everyone in the project to see the changes. One major advantage that makes Github an effective tool for collaboration is that it allows for the current version of a project to be reversed in case someone makes a mistake (About GitHub and Git, no date). Github Pages is a hosting service that is provided by Github that allows for a website to be published from a Github repository. Github pages is best used for documentation of code or to show a cv/portfolio (What is GitHub Pages?, 2025).

Git is the version control library that Github is based on. Git uses command line functions to enable version control. Some notable functions are *git status*, *git commit*, *git push* and *git pull*. *git status* is used to show the current working directory and staging area. You can use option such as *-s* to shorten the output or *-u* to show untracked file. *git status* is a useful command as it allows you to check where you are working and can stop any accidental changes being made to another branch. *git commit* creates a snapshot of all staged changes including a log message of all changes made. You can use options such as *-m* which allows for a message to be added to the commit or *--ammend* which edits the last commit. *git commit* is an essential part of Git as it is the main way of making changes to the repository. *git push* is used to update any branch in a remote repository to a local repository and sends any data that isn't remote. You can use options such as *--branches* to add all branches to the local repository or you can use *--delete* to delete the specified branch. *git push* allows for changes to be seen by others by uploading the local repository to the remote repository. *git pull* is used to fetch a branch from the remote repository to the local repository and intergrate it to the current branch. You can use options such as *--commit* to merge the branches or *--all* to fetch all branches. *git pull* allows for changes to be made to other branches and can be used to merge the results (Git Documentation, no date).

Before I started this module, I had very basic and limited knowledge of Github. I was able to navigate a repository and download files but I had never created a repository myself. I did struggle with understanding how pull and push requests work but now I understand them better. I was able to understand Git a lot easier as I already have knowledge of command line interfaces and how they work. Collaborative tools such as Github are important on my academic journey and professional development as I will be working on group projects which require collaboration, version control and shared access. Github Pages will be an important tool to use as it will allow me to present a portfolio to potential employers. By using these skills I have learnt together, I will be able to showcase my technical skills and collaborative skills effeciently.

## Continous Professional Development (CPD)
In this module, we learnt about Continuous Professional Development (CPD). Continuous Professional Development is the term used to describe the learning activities professionals undertake to develop their skills. CPD is an important factor in any professional's journey as it ensures that their skills are up to date and relevant to the field. There are numerous ways for someone to undertake Continuous Professional Development. A professional could take course related to their field or attend an educational event (CPD UK, 2025). One way I intend to show my Continuous Professional Development is by joining societies such as the Alliance fo Data Scientists and Linkedin. With these professional networks, I will be able to network and become certified as a data scientist. In my course, I will be undertaking modules that will be focued on Data, Machine Learning, AI and programming. These modules will further my technical capabilities and help me gain the skills that the industry requires. I will also be undertaking group projects as part of my assessments which will help me develop my team worker and communication skills. Along with these modules and assessments, I can take advantage of workshops or guest speakers to further understand and hone my skills (Harper Adams University, 2026). 

Key academic milestones I hope to achieve are finishing the final project as it will allow me showcase my skills I have gained throughout the years on this course. Completing the final project will also help achieve key learning outcomes such as applying rigorous analytical methods to primary and secondary sources to investigate specific data science question, hypothesis or problem and ethically conduct research with minimal supervision. With these skills, I will hopefully look for employment or go into further study (Data scientist job profile, no date). The skills I gain in this course will help me with my Contiuous Professional Development by allowing me to apply my technical skills to real world scenarios, improve my computing and programming skills and identify any areas that need improving.

## Responsible Use for AI
In this module, we covered AI and the responsible ways to use AI. AI for academic use should be used to support your work, not to replace it. According to the university AI guidelines, AI can be used to help think more creatively or efficiently but it has a tendency to be biased or give misleading information. One responsible use of AI would be to use it to get feedback on your writing. You could ask an AI "How could I phrase this better?" and it would give you multiple examples you could pick from. This can allow you to make your work sound more concise or academic. One way not to use AI would be using it as a source. AI can generate sources that are false or don't exist and potentially even lead to plagiarism (Islam, 2025). AI should only be used to elevate your current work rather than replacing it as it would not be a true showcase of your abilities. One way to avoid AI plagiarism is to cross reference it with other credible sources. This will ensure that your work will be factual and true despite the use of AI. AI will only further evolve which means that I must be ready to use it effectively and responsibly in my future professional career. In a data scientist context, I might use AI to automate data management. Data scientists spend much of their time cleaning data and managing data sets but by automating this, data scientists can spend time on more important tasks such as analysing data (AI in Data Science: Uses, Examples, and Tools to Consider, 2024).
